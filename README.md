Cherno OpenGL tutorial
======================

I wanna learn OpenGL, so I follow this tutorial to start with.

Eventually, I want to extend this with

- [ ] Get some ImGUI working
- [ ] Draw meshes of some 3D functions
- [ ] CUDA interop
  - Generate or modify some data in CUDA world, render that with OpenGL
